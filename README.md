# PythonToTeX
The project can be used to transform Python arrays into LaTeX code which can help save time.

For instance, you may feel bored and annoyed to input a "bmatrix" in LaTex like:

    $\begin{pmatrix}
    1&3&4&6&9\\
    1&1&2&1&10\\
    2&5&1&9&2\\
    \end{pmatrix}$
    
It's really a complex work when you face a huge matrix. In this project, we may solve it by using Python.
